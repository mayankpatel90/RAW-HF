# RAW-HF
Enabling PostgreSQL and other DBMS to monitor resource utilization information and allocate query-specific resources in real-time.

It's a java code, and works like a web code. That connects to external DBMSs like PostgreSQL, PostgresRAW, and others.
It also requires the top and iohop tools installed on Ubuntu OS to monitor and analyze the real-time resource utilization of the system and workload tasks.

You can this code in any took with JDK like VS, or Eclipse.

I have not added any license information yet. Because I am still working on it, and if anyone wants to use or update it.
